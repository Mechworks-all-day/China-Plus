02-10-2022 (Version 0.8)
Initial public upload, considered pre-1.0 only because I can't make images work myself.

02-10-2022 (Version 0.8.1) (+3 hours, that didn't take long)
Fixed Autocorrupt having changed "Grand Temple" to "Granted Temple" without me noticing,
Temporarily changed Rice bonus to just check the base terrain even though that's not the desired behavior, 
pending me re-reading the tileFilter section to see if I can work out the right syntax for 'Farm that is also on a hill' 
and 'farm that is also on a river'
