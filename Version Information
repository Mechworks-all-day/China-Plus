02-10-2022 (Version 0.8)
Initial public upload, considered pre-1.0 only because I can't make images work myself.

02-10-2022 (Version 0.8.1) (+3 hours, that didn't take long)
Fixed Autocorrupt having changed "Grand Temple" to "Granted Temple" without me noticing,
Temporarily changed Rice bonus to just check the base terrain even though that's not the desired behavior, 
pending me re-reading the tileFilter section to see if I can work out the right syntax for 'Farm that is also on a hill' 
and 'farm that is also on a river'

03-10-2022 (Version 0.8.2) (it's *barely* past midnight, but it counts.)
Fixed (hopefully) the issue with Rice so it will work as intended. Hopefully. Cross your fingers.

03-10-2022 (Version 0.8.3) (close enough to 10 am for government work)
Icons are now working thanks to Bamboolord, imaginary cookie has been dispached.

03-10-2022 (Version 0.8.4) (not even five minutes T^T)
Reduced icon size to 60×60 to lower overhead (and the actual data size, ha) and changed the Promotion ones to white so they'll tint properly.

10-11-2022 (Version 0.9)
Major refactor of various building effects, minor fixes to previously nonfunctional things rolled in.

Should be the last one... Before GLORIOUS NIPPON!
